# torch==2.3.1 # These are likely not needed on Streamlit Cloud, as Whisper uses pre-built models
# torchvision==0.18.1

# FFmpeg is a system dependency required by moviepy and Whisper for audio/video processing.
# Streamlit Cloud requires specifying system dependencies.
# This will be handled in .streamlit/packages.txt, NOT in requirements.txt.
