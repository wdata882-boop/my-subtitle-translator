# PyTorch is a dependency of Whisper, but often installed automatically.
# If you face issues, you can specify it:
# torch==2.3.1 # Or a compatible version for your environment
# torchvision==0.18.1 # If you need it for other tasks (Whisper may not require this)

# FFmpeg is a system dependency required by moviepy and Whisper for audio/video processing.
# Streamlit Cloud requires specifying system dependencies.
# This will be handled in .streamlit/packages.txt, NOT in requirements.txt.
